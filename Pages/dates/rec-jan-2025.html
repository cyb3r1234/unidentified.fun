            I woke up today expecting nothing I was thinking it was gonna be a ruglar wednesday but I'd later be proven wrong. When I got to school something felt odd a weird feeling that I couldn't understand but I didn't pay much attention to it. Then at 2nd period it was pretty regular and I hadn't notice anything. Then onto 4th period One of my friends had told me that you were gonna ask me out today, I was hesitant at first but I decided to trust him and wait and see, the anticipation was killing me I wasn't sure if what he said was true or if it was gonna happend today during this time I was thinking "it wouldn't happen today out off all days right?". Then lunch came and I had butterflies and my heart racing at 2000mph I was shaking of nervousness and I couldn't stop thinking of what my friend had said, towards the middle to end of lunch I notice that your friend was calling over one of my friend and I was confused but I had a feeling something was gonna happen and when I went to go ask why your friends had asked my friend over to your table you had ran. Afterwards I got the paper, my inintial reaction was "WHATTTTT!!!!!" because honestly I couldn't believe it was gonna happen today of all days and that it is happening now... So my obvious answer was yes, however the paper got snatched out of my hands by some dumb people. I also remember one of my friends encouraging me to go talk to you but I simply couldn't out of the fear and <a href="/Pages/final-page/heartfelt-goodbye.html"> nervousness</a>. After classes ended you came over to my 8th period and we talked for a bit and you gave me our first hug of many. The entire time I couldn't believe the fact someone like me has a girlfriend, I also felt like I was in a literal dream. None of this felt real, I felt like the reality I was in wasn't real. As much as I love this day it was a bit unexpected and really random but this has to be one of the favorite day of my life by far.
