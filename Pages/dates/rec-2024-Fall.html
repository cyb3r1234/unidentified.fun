          During this time, school had just started. This new change was a lot
          to handle, confusing, and kind of hard to get used to, but it was
          easier than I had originally thought. Also, during this time, I had
          met you. I was perplexed and confused because my first thought was,
          "Dang, this girl is mad pretty, but I won't ever have a chance with
          her." Then one day, I remember you talking to me. You came off as
          annoying and mean, so I didn't know how to react. I tried to give the
          same back. Looking back now, it all makes sense, and I feel stupid for
          not noticing earlier.
