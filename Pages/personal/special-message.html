      <h1>Happy 3 Months!!</h1>
      <p>
        So much has happened in just 3 months, and it's crazy to think about how
        much time I've spent with you. I cherish every second with you.
        <span class="hint">
          By the way, this isn't the end of the website—there are little secrets
          hidden everywhere, starting here. The first one has to do with the
          image. Good luck!
        </span>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, this took me so long to make—I started working on this website on
        April 1st! I know this isn't much, but I hope you like it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love you so much, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for
        us.

        ps: Click on the screen on the secret pages for a suprise !
